# Data Strutures And Algorithms In CPP

A small C++ header library implements some popular data structures and algorithms.   

I try to implement some of data structures and algorithms that I have been learning becauce of a simple reason. I am learning them today and will forget everything about them tomorrow ðŸ˜….

## About the Library
- The library is written in C++, placed in `experimental` namespace and stored in `./inc/`
- There is an unit test for each type of data structures and sorting algorithms, which can be found in `./ut`, to evaluate the correctness of the implementation.

### Data Structures
- [vector](./inc/ds/experimental_vector.hpp): automatically-resized container in which elements are stored contiguously.
- [stack](./inc/ds/experimental_stack.hpp): FIFO data structure that supports `push` elements to and `pop` elements from the end.
- [list](./inc/ds/experimental_list.hpp): container that supports insertion and removal of elements at anywhere in the container.    
In this library, `list` is implemented as a doubly-linked list.
- [binary search tree](./inc/ds/experimental_binary_search_tree.hpp): tree data structure in which a node can only have at max two children. The value of a node is greater than value of any nodes from the left subtree and less than value of any nodes from the right subtree.   
In this library, `binary search tree` does not store duplicates.
- [avl tree](./inc/ds/experimental_avl_tree.hpp): auto-balancing binary search tree.   
In this library, `avl tree` does not store duplicates.
- [binary heap](./inc/ds/experimental_binary_heap.hpp): a node has at max two children and its value is not greater than its children.   
In this library, `binary heap` is defaulted as a **min heap** and supports duplicates.

### Sorting Algorithms
- [insertion sort](./inc/sorts/experimental_insertion_sort.hpp)
- [heap sort](./inc/sorts/experimental_heap_sort.hpp)
- [shell sort](./inc/sorts/experimental_shell_sort.hpp): uses Sedgewick's increment sequence.
- [merge sort](./inc/sorts/experimental_merge_sort.hpp)
- [quick sort](./inc/sorts/experimental_quick_sort.hpp): strategy of picking pivot is to select the median of the three: `arr[left], arr[center], arr[right]`

### Unit Tests
Each unit test is a function that returns `true` if the test is passed, `false` otherwise. And the macro `_RUN_UNIT_TEST_(X)` is designated to run a specific unit test and output the result to console.

## Sorting Algorithm Benchmark
Test and time the running time of sorting algorithms with various inputs.  
The sorting algorithms that are benchmarked are:   
- Heap sort
- Shell sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort

All the code that is used to generate the benchmark inputs as well as run the test can be found in `./sorting_benchmark`.

### Inputs
There are three main inputs that are used to benchmark, which are only integer numbers.    
- **Small keys**: Inputs that contain only a few unique keys. The unique keys account for one percentage (**1%**) of the input's size.    
- **Unique keys**: Inputs that contain unique keys (no duplicate).
- **Normal distributed keys**: Inputs that are generated from C++ standard normal distribution generator.    

For the first two types of inputs, there are four properties that are combined with: 
- **Sorted**: The list is sorted in ascending order.
- **Reversed sorted**: The list is sorted in descending order.
- **Almost sorted**: The list is sorted then suffled. The percentage of numbers that are suffled is five percentage (**5%**) of the input's size.
- **Random**: The list is in random order.   

For the normal distributed inputs, there are two properties that are combined with:   
- **Small deviation**: The standard deviation is set to _**size/100.0**_ where **size** is the input's size.
- **Large deviation**: The standard deviation is set to _**size/10.0**_.   

>**Note:** The generated input size can be quite large. The total size is about **41GB**.

### Setup
There are five different generated lists for each type of inputs. Each list is run once and the average of five results is calculated.   

To measure the running time, `std::chrono::high_resolution_clock` from C++ standard library is called before and after a sorting function's call.

All the tests were run in a laptop with CPU of **1.8 Ghz** (no boosting technology).

### Results
Execution times are given in **microseconds**.

## To do
- Implement some special sorting algorithms like radix sort.
- Try to implement multi-threading shell sort since it seems to be able to do so.

## Acknowledgement
- Thanks to **Data Structures And Algorithm Analysis in C++ (4th ed) - Mark Allen Weiss** book for detailed explanation about those data structures and algorithms.
- Special thanks to my laptop for keeping its sanity in about an hour to generate sorting benchmark inputs and about three hours straight to run those tests.
